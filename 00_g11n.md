# Globalization

The translation workflow is based on GNU gettext.

To generate the initial or update existing translation files run the following command. This example uses English (`en`) as the target locale. To use different locales simply exchange `en` in the example for the target locale you desire...

```
$ make app/resources/g11n/po/en/LC_MESSAGES/default.po
```

Missing translations can then be filled in using your favorite application, i.e. [POEdit](https://poedit.net/).
